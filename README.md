### Installation
1. Get the code. We will call the directory that you cloned Caffe into `$CAFFE_ROOT`
  ```Shell
  git clone https://github.com/BestSonny/SSTD.git
  cd SSTD
  ```

2. Build the code. Please follow [Caffe instruction](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html) to install all necessary packages and build it.
  ```Shell
  # Modify Makefile.config according to your Caffe installation.
  cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
  make -j8
  # Make sure to include $CAFFE_ROOT/python to your PYTHONPATH.
  make py
  make test -j8
  # (Optional)
  make runtest -j8
  # build nms
  cd examples/text
  make
  cd ..
  ```
3. Run the demo code. Download Model [here](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0Bx8FPKhlXE1lOTF1TzIxOGhsblk) and put it in `text/model` folder
  ```Shell
  cd examples
  sh text/download.sh
  mkdir text/result
  python text/demo_test.py
  ```
